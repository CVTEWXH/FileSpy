# FileSpy

A mechanism to protect files from ransomware.
This driver will will force each program to use the shadow copy as if it was accessing the real copy.  Changings to the real copy only occurs when the driver moves the changes over to the real file.

FileSpy was the old name for this driver the project is called misdirection: Not the file you thought you wrote.
